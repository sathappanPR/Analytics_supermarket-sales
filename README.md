Salutations to all. I'm happy to announce that my second Excel data analytics project has been completed and is now accessible in the form of a quick video presentation on my LinkedIn page. The URL to access it is provided below. This project covers the first three months of product sales for three different grocery branches in three different locations. A, B, and C are the branches. Yangon, Mandalay, and Naypyitaw are the respective locations.
